## **Deactivating and Reactivating Users**

An Admin user can Deactivate users when they are no longer needed in the system or no longer needed to fulfill duties. This would remove the user from showing up in selection lists throughout the application (e.g. task assignment). To deactivate the user, locate the user and click on 'Deactivate' button (shown below) and follow with a 'Yes' to the next prompt. The user has been deactivated once the button now says 'Reactivate' for that user. To reactivate is the same process, click on 'Reactivate' and the user is live in the system again.
