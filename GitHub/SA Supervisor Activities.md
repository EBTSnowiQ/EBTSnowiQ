1. From Routes tab by pressing 'Assign new drivers'. 
2. From the Driver Details panel by pressing 'Add Task'.  
3. From Map Monitoring view on either the Routes or Drivers

### **Assigning New Drivers**

* In the 'Assign Drivers' dialogue complete the following:
  * Select type of Activity
  * Specify whether the assignment is Single-Pass or Multi-Pass  (switch the toggle on for Multi-Pass)
  * Specify whether it is a priority task (switch the toggle on to indicate yes)

* This will add the assignment to the Route Details with the name of the Driver and the Assignment status of 'Pending' to indicate that the Assignment has been sent to the Driver but not accepted yet. It also adds the Assignment to the Future list of Assignments for the Driver, as can in the next section. It also prompts the Driver in the Driver App (DA) to accept the Assignment

### **Adding Tasks**

A Supervisor can add a new task to a Driver, by the following the steps below:

* From the Driver Details panel, tap 'Add Task'

![Screenshot 2021-03-08 083818](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79857237/110329800-14ec3a80-7feb-11eb-8c2c-bd0c983fb2fb.png)

* In the 'Create Driver Assignment' dialogue complete the following:
  * Select type of Activity
  * Specify whether the assignment is Single-Pass or Multi-Pass (switch the toggle on for Multi-Pass)
  * Specify wheter it is a priority task (switch the toggle on to indicate yes: this moves the assignment to the top of the queue of the Future list of assignments for the driver)
  * Type a note to the driver

## **Completing Assignments for Multi-Passes**

A multi-pass Assignment (when assignment was created, the multi-pass toggled was switched to On) requires a Supervisor to determine the next step after each pass completed by the Driver. Once the Driver completes a pass, a Supervisor receives a 'Pass Completion Notice' prompt with the details about the assignment, including the number of passes made, as seen below. A Supervisor has two options: either 
1. Tap 'Another Pass' to notify the Driver to continue working on the assignment or
1. Tap 'Complete' to complete the multi-pass assignment. 

If a Supervisor selects 'Option 1' the system notifies the Driver to continue working on the assignment, i.e. make another pass. With 'Option 2' the system marks the multi-pass Assignment as Completed and removes it from the Driver's Active Assignments into the History tab **DA - Driver Activities**

It will also notify the Driver to accept the ticket assignment. (The process can be seen here.) 

## **Pausing or Resuming Drivers**

A Supervisor can pause an active Assignment that a Driver is working on or resume by following the steps below: (the reasons to pause: refil salt or go to gas station to document that no work is being performed on the route â€“ no breadcrumbs are accumulated)

* From the Driver Details panel, tap 'Pause' and then 'Yes' on the verification prompt

* The system pauses the Driver (status is changed to 'Paused') and notifies the Driver in the Driver App that their Assignment has been paused and to wait for further instructions
* To resume the assignment, tap 'Resume' on the Driver that's been paused, as seen below

 ![Screenshot 2021-03-08 084307](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79857237/110329915-32210900-7feb-11eb-9d94-8704b37ac7fd.png)
