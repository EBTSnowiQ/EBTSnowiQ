Driver App Application (Android or iOS)
Both the Android and iOS applications have the same functionality and the screenshots below are a combination of both.
Login
The login screen below allows Driver users to enter the SnowIQ Driver Application (DA). Click the appropriate 'Login' button to be re-routed to enter the assigned User Name and Password for the application.

     
                        
Once logged into the DA, Drivers will see the screen below. The screens display two types of drivers logged in, a County Driver and a Contractor. The difference is identified in the status of the Driver. The County Driver, on the left, has a status of 'Ready' whereas the Contractor, on the right, is in 'Standby.' The circle next to the profile picture indicates that this a County Driver and a square is a Contractor. These icons are color coded to match the status (find an explanation for the colors and statuses here).

Users can open the Navigation Drawer by pressing the User Profile picture icon as specified in the diagram above. The panel is divided into three sections: (1) User Profile details (2) Supervisor details (3) Operations menu 
 
User Profile Details
This section lists the profile details of logged in driver. To edit them, the user can press 'Profile' in the section below.
