## Accepting and Working Assignments

- Get directions to the location of the assignment by using the navigate button in the app (the blue arrow icon in the top right corner), which opens Google Maps to provide those   directions. 
- Once the system starts tracking that the Driver is working on the assignment, i.e. the Driver's GPS location is on the assigned route or address, the system will change the       status of the Active Assignment to 'Started' in the status bar and begin displaying breadcrumbs to indicate the route that was worked on, as seen below. 
- Alternatively, the Driver can manually go to the Navigation drawer and press 'Start Assignment' as seen below. 

## Completing Assignment 
A Driver can complete their Active Assignment by opening the Navigation drawer and pressing 'Complete Assignment' as seen below.
