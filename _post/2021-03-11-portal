  ### **Ticket Status**

  * New - The system checked that the 311 ticket is valid for assignment or a new emergency ticket was created but not sent out for assignment yet.
  * Sent - The Admin user reviewed the ticket and sent it to Supervisor App (SA) for assignment creation.
  * Assigned - The Supervisor created the Assignement in the SA and sent it to the Driver, but the work hasn't began yet.
  * In Progress - The Driver began working on the ticket assignment.
  * Closed:
      1. An Admin user manually closes a ticket that they deem invalid or that doesn't need work
      1. The system has checked the sevice request and found it invalid and set the ticket to closed
      1. The assigned driver has completed the task and marked the assignment as completed - which closes the ticket throughout all systems.
   * Pending - The system found the ticket to be invalid and is preparing to close the ticket.
